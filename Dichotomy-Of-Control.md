# Dichotomy of Control
- According Epictetus, our most important choice in life is whether to concern ourselves with things external to us or things internal
- Epictetus would give up the rewards the external world has to offer in order to gain "tranquillity, freedom, and calm"
- Most people seek to gain contentment by changing the world around them
- Epictetus advises us to gain contetntment by changing ourselves, by changing our desires
- If you seek is contentment, it is easier to change yourself and what you want than change the world around you
- Your primary desire should be your desire not to be frustrated by forming desires you won't be able to fulfill
- If you success, you will no longer experience anxiety about whether or not you will get what you want
- "If you refuse to enter contests that you are capable of losing, you will never lose a contest", Epictetus
- "Some things are up to us and some are not up to us", Epictetus
