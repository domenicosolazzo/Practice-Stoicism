# Negative Visualization

- We are periodically contemplating bad things that can happen to us.

1. We want to prevent them from happening to us.
  - Some will happen anyway.
2. According Seneca, thinking about these things should lessen their impact when they happen to us.
  - If we assume that will always be able to enjoy the things we value, we will be subject to distress when the things we value are taken away from us
3. We are insatiable; after we get what we want, we rroutinely lose interest in the object of our desire. We do not feel satisfied and we search for grander desires.
  - This is called **hedonic adaptation**
  - Prevent ourself for taking things for granted
  - Learn how to want the things that we already have
  - Stoics use Negative Visualization
  - 
  
- Negative visualization is one of the most important psychological's tools 
- Imagine that we have lost things that we value
- Remember that nothing is forever
  - "We should love all of our dear ones..., but always with the thought that we have no promise that we may keep them forever; nay, no promise even that we may keep them for long"
