List of quotes from some famous stoic philosophers

### Marcus Aurelius
- Everything that exists is in a manner the seed of that which will be
- Forward, as occasion offers. Never look round to see whether any shall note it... Be satisfied with success in even the smallest matter, and think that even such a result is no trifle
- It is not death that a man should fear, but he should fear never beginning to live
- Let it be your constant method to look into the design of people's actions, and see what they would be at, as often as it is practicable; and to make this custom the more significant, practice it first upon yourself
- Loss is nothing else but change, and change is Nature's delight
- Never let the future disturb you. You will meet it, if you have to, with the same weapons of reason which today arm you against the present
- Everything, a horse, a vine, is created for some duty. For what task, then, were you yourself created? A man’s true delight is to do the things he was made for
- You have power over your mind, not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength
- Everything we hear is an opinion, not a fact. Everything we see is a perspective, not the truth
- Waste no more time arguing about what a good man should be. Be one
- Live a good life. If there are gods and they are just, then they will not care how devout you have been, but will welcome you based on the virtues you have lived by. If there are gods, but unjust, then you should not want to worship them. If there are no gods, then you will be gone, but will have lived a noble life that will live on in the memories of your loved ones
- Let no act be done without purpose.
- He who is brave is fearless; he who is fearless is free from sadness; he who is free from sadness is happy.
- Concentrate every minute on doing what's in front of you with precise and genuine seriousness, tenderly, willingly, with justice. And on freeing yourself from all other distractions. Yes, you can, if you do everything as if it were the last thing you were doing in your life, and stop being aimless, stop letting your emotions override what your mind tells you, stop being hypocritical, self-centred, irritable. You see how few things you have to do to live a satisfying and reverent life? If you can manage this, that's all even the gods can ask of you.
- Were you to live three thousand years, or even thirty thousand, remember that the sole life which a man can lose is that which he is living at the moment...he can have no other life than the one he loses. For the passing minute is every man's equal possession, but what has once gone by is not ours.
- To live each day as though one's last, never flustered, never apathetic, never attitudinizing – here is perfection of character.
- Nothing happens to anybody that he is not fitted by Nature to bear.
- The obstacle is the way.
- When you wake up in the morning, tell yourself: The people I deal with today will be meddling, ungrateful, arrogant, dishonest, jealous, and surly. They are like this because they can’t tell good from evil. But I have seen the beauty of good, and the ugliness of evil, and have recognized that the wrongdoer has a nature related to my own — not of the same blood or birth, but of the same mind, and possessing a share of the divine. And so none of them can hurt me. No one can implicate me in ugliness. Nor can I feel angry at my relative, or hate him. We were born to work together like feet, hands, and eyes, like the two rows of teeth, upper and lower. To obstruct each other is unnatural. To feel anger at someone, to turn your back on him: these are obstructions.
- If you are distressed by anything external, the pain is not due to the thing itself, but to your estimate of it; and this you have the power to revoke at any moment.
- Let opinion be taken away, and no man will think himself wronged. If no man shall think himself wronged, then is there no more any such thing as wrong. 

### Seneca
- Misfortune wighs most heavily on thos who expect nothing but good fortune.
- Difficulties strengthen the mind, as labor does the body.
- Be silent as to services you have rendered, but speak of favours you have received.
- True happiness is to enjoy the present, without anxious dependence upon the future.
- Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity.
- If a man knows not to which port he sails, no wind is favorable.
- Limiting one’s desires actually helps to cure one of fear. Cease to hope … and you will cease to fear.
- You act like mortals in all that you fear, and like immortals in all that you desire
- Verba rebus proba.
-  Furthermore, that you may know in what manner passions begin and swell and gain spirit, learn that the first emotion is involuntary, and is, as it were, a preparation for a passion, and a threatening of one. The next is combined with a wish, though not an obstinate one, as, for example, “It is my duty to avenge myself, because I have been injured,” or “It is right that this man should be punished, because he has committed a crime.” The third emotion is already beyond our control, because it overrides reason, and wishes to avenge itself, not if it be its duty, but whether or no. We are not able by means of reason to escape from that first impression on the mind, any more than we can escape from those things which we have mentioned as occurring to the body: we cannot prevent other people’s yawns temping us to yawn; we cannot help winking when fingers are suddenly darted at our eyes. Reason is unable to overcome these habits, which perhaps might be weakened by practice and constant watchfulness: they differ from an emotion which is brought into existence and brought to an end by a deliberate mental act.

### Epictetus
- We should keep in mind that all things everywhere are perishable.
- It's not what happens to you, but how you react to it that matters.
- There is only one way to happiness and that is to cease worrying about things which are beyond the power of our will.
- Reason is not measured by size or height, but by principle.
- It is difficulties that show what men are.
- Some things are in our control and others not. Things in our control are opinion, pursuit, desire, aversion, and, in a word, whatever are our own actions. Things not in our control are body, property, reputation, command, and, in one word, whatever are not our own actions.
- First learn the meaning of what you say, and then speak.
- If you want to improve, be content to be thought foolish and stupid.
- Silence is safer than speech.
- Make the best use of what is in your power, and take the rest as it happens.
- First say to yourself what you would be; and then do what you have to do.
- The appearance of things to the mind is the standard of every action to man.
- If, for example, you are fond of a specific ceramic cup, remind yourself that it is only ceramic cups in general of which you are fond. Then, if it breaks, you will not be disturbed. If you kiss your child, or your wife, say that you only kiss things which are human, and thus you will not be disturbed if either of them dies.
- Whatever you would make habitual, practice it; and if you would not make a thing habitual, do not practice it, but accustom yourself to something else.
- Wealth consists not in having great possessions, but in having few wants.
- It is not external events themselves that cause us distress, but they way in which we think about them, our interpretation of their significance. It is our attitudes and reactions that give us trouble. We cannot choose our external circumstances, but we can always choose how we respond to them.
- When you are going to take in hand any act, remind yourself what kind of an act it is. If you are going to bathe, place before yourself what happens in the bath: some splashing the water, others pushing against one another, others abusing one another, and some stealing: and thus with more safety you will undertake the matter, if you say to yourself, I now intend to bathe, and to maintain my will in a manner con­formable to nature. And so you will do in every act: for thus if any hindrance to bathing shall happen, let this thought be ready; it was not this only that I intended, but I intended also to maintain my will in a way conformable to nature; but I shall not maintain it so, if I am vexed at what happens.
- Men are disturbed not by the things which happen, but by the opinions about the things; for example, death is nothing terrrible, for if it were it would have seened so to Socrates; for the opinion about death that is terrible, is the terrible thing. When we are impeded or disturbed, or grieved, let us never blame others, but ourselves - that is, our opinions.
- When you lose control of your imagination and it bites deep into your soul, struggle against it with your reason, fight it down, don’t let it grow strong and call up at pleasure what images it will.

# Musonius Rufus 
- Thus it appears that exile helps, rather than hinders body and spirit, by treating them better than they treat themselves.
