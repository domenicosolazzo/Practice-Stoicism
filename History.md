# The beginning
- Stoicism is a school of Hellenistic philosophy founded in Athens by Zeno of Citium in the early 3rd century BC.
- They were concerned about the active relationship between cosmic determinism and human freedom
- They have also a belief that it is virtuous to maintain a will that is in accord with nature.
- Stoics presented Stoicism as a way of life
- An individual's philosophy was not what a person said but how that person behaved
- "virtue is sufficient for happiness", a sage was immune to misfortune. 
- This belief is similar to the meaning of the phrase "stoic calm".
